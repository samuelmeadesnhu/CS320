1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure my code is functional and secure, I can follow testing tehniques including reviews, unit testing, and thorough planning. These tehniques can help address potential issues prior to a deployment, and set a vision for the project. 

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs can be interpreted through unit tests. Incorporating these unit tests prior to developing the program through test-driven development is a sure way to work with user requirements at the priority.

3. How do I approach designing software?

Designing software should be collaborative and thorough. It is important to not over-speculate unknowns, and to allow the project to bend to an AGILE framework - while simultaneously maintaining UMLs and structure to match any incoming pivots.
